# CS50-SQL-Projects

This repository contains solutions and SQL queries for the **CS50 SQL** course problem sets, covering querying, data manipulation, database design, and analysis across different domains.

## Overview
This course, **CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL**, is developed by **Harvard University and Cambridge**. Throughout these problem sets, I applied SQL in various real-world contexts, including:

âœ” **Writing complex queries** (`SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`)
âœ” **Designing and managing relational databases**
âœ” **Performing data analysis** to extract insights
âœ” **Creating database schemas** for business applications
âœ” **Implementing data integrity and normalization**
âœ” **Cleaning and transforming raw datasets** into structured databases
âœ” **Optimizing queries using indexing techniques**
âœ” **Working with views** for aggregation, partitioning, and securing data
âœ” **Understanding database scalability and performance tuning**
âœ” **Implementing security measures**, prepared statements, and penetration testing
