CS50-SQL-Projects

Comprehensive SQL problem-set solutions and database design exercises from Harvard’s CS50: Introduction to Databases with SQL

Overview

This repository contains structured solutions and SQL queries developed for CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL, a course by Harvard University and the University of Cambridge.
Each problem set addresses real-world database scenarios, focusing on querying, data manipulation, schema design, optimization, and security.

Topics Covered

Complex SQL querying (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY)

Relational database modeling and normalization

Data cleaning and transformation of raw datasets

Schema design with constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK)

Query optimization and indexing (EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN, CREATE INDEX)

Views and aggregation for simplified analysis and restricted access

Transaction management and concurrency control

Security, prepared statements, and SQL injection prevention

Distributed databases, scaling, and replication
